If you are using one of the old decks, e.g. "A Course in Contemporary Chinese with Hanzi Writer/Sound" or "PAVC with Hanzi Writer/Sound" and want to switch to this improved version, then replace the "En" in the card names with "Mn" or execute the script preImport.py
Then import the new package.
After importing, remove the fields #TODO
